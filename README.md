This repo stores my solutions of the supplemental problem sets from MIT 18.02SC Fall 2010. Only the solutions for the problems without solutions in the supplemental problem sets are recorded. 
All the answers are done by myself. If there are any mistakes, please email to me lu.yuxun.lp6 GUESS_WHICH_SYMBOL_IS_HERE naist.jp. Thanks.
